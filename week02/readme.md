## Project 1: Alternative Currency

Create a currency, trade it to someone (outside of class; non-Oberlin student might be most interesting) for a something material. This can include a good or service, but try to purchase something other than a "silly dance", "smile" or something to that effect. Document your process and bring the purchased object or documentation to class.

+ In creating your currency, ask yourself: "What do I want this to be worth? Is this exchangeable? Would people consider it to be a legitimate exchange?"

+ Feel free to use existing currencies as a starting point, or to completely re-imagine the mode and materiality of currency. It's possible that the manner in which you facilitate the exchange will be as important or interesting as the currency you develop.
