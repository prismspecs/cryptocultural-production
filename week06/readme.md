+ Introduce Project 2
	+ Groups (or solo) create a speculative cryptocurrency/blockchain project. Write a white paper, create a website, market your project. Once complete, pitch your project to a panel during class. Be sure to investigate existing projects in the vein of what you are attempting.
	+ Again, feel free to create this in the mode of existing projects in the blockchain ecosystem, or to re-imagine the technology, or simply be as absurd or experimental as you would like.
	+ As with all projects in this class, you may fudge some of the rules but only if you have good reason to do so.
	+ The white paper doesn't have to be very long, feel free to keep it short and concise (or completely subvert this idea altogether). [Here's a link](https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/05/how-to-write-a-cryptocurrency-white-paper/) on how to write a white paper.
